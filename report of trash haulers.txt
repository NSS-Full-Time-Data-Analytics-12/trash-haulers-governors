report of trash haulers

explain the setting (the situation) (where the data comes from)

explain what the city of nashville asked us to analyze

(what questions do they need answered?)

explain how we cleaned up the data

make addresses consistent

find where there are missed pickup complaints 3 or more times per address
(from 20,000 aprox. to 6000 aprox)

fill in blank trash haulers, zip codes, routes for more accurate analysis

original was 20000 then all missed complaints was 18000 then finable was about 6000

use the finable data to make a more detailed comparison of trash haulers and routes
